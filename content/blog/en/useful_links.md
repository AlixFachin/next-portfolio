Here is a list of tools and websites I use often for web design...

# Front-End design

* [Palette Color Generator](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending) to find good color compositions
* [Font Flipper](https://fontflipper.com/upload) to find original fonts
* [SERP Generator](https://serpsim.com/) To preview the meta parameters you put on the page (?)
* [SVG Wave Generator](https://svgwave.in/) Maybe I used this too much on this site?

# Stock pictures and icons

# Coding books and references
* About the event loop
