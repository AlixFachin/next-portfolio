Here is a list of tools and websites I use often for web design...
This page will be a work in progress as I will write down other interesting stuff as I find them.

## Front-End design

* [Palette Color Generator](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending) to find good color compositions
* [Font Flipper](https://fontflipper.com/upload) to find original fonts
* [SVG Wave Generator](https://svgwave.in/) Maybe I used this too much on this site?

## Stock pictures and icons
* [Experience Japan Pictograms](https://experience-japan.info) For some original icons related to Japan
* [Find47.jp](https://find47.jp) Stock pictures about places in Japan
* [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com) Huuuuge source of great pictures which can be used along proper attribution

## Coding books and references
* [About the event loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCOL7MC4Pl0) Great presentation by Jake Archibald regarding the event loop in JavaScript


## Youtube content about development
* [Fireship.io](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship)
* [John Herrigan](https://www.youtube.com/@jherr)
* [HTTP 203](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl9R8aTOW_I)
