## Summary
Hello! My name is Alix Fachin and I am working as a software engineer at [Roomboss.com](www.roomboss/.com).
I studied Computer Science and Applied Mathematics in France and graduated in 2001, then worked in finance for 10 years, first as a software engineer and then as a trader.
In 2012 I left finance and found a job in hospitality, managing a property management company in a ski resort in Hokkaido, Japan through [Escape the City](https://www.escapethecity.org/).
I worked as a manager in hospitality for 10 years. During this time I coded on a side as a hobby, but COVID-19 pushed me to commit to do this full-time. I registered to a intensive 3-months bootcamp in Tokyo, [Code Chrysalis](https://www.codechrysalis.io/) to polish my skills and re-started my career as software engineer.

## My time in Finance
I began my career with an internship at **Societe Generale in Tokyo**, programming a plugin in Java displaying in real-time ratios between stocks to help the traders identify pair-trading opportunities. I came back to SG Tokyo after graduation to work as a front-office developer, to develop quickly tools helping traders with risk analysis and trading. I worked specifically on a automated trading strategy dealing with listed derivatives on the South Korean index Kospi 200. After two years of this, I was asked to become a trader in 2003 and since then worked mainly as a trader.
I was hired by the **Citadel hedge fund** to join their market making team. They wanted to adapt their highly successful market making strategy in Asia. It didn't work out, and then I joined **JP Morgan** in Hong-Kong to participate in the setup of their derivatives market-making system.
I worked for JP Morgan first in Hong-Kong, then in New York, in the same market making team.
In 2012 I was tired of finance for plenty of reasons, and we decided to go back to Japan to raise our young family. I found a job in Hokkaido with [Escape the City](https://www.escapethecity.org/) and I took the chance to work in a more "people-oriented" job.

## My time in Hospitality
I was interested in working to make people happy (I entertained the idea to opening a cafe in Tokyo since 2005, but didn't find the right opportunity), so working in hospitality checked a lot of boxes. In 2012 there were not many bootcamps available, so the possibility to "refresh" my skills as a software engineer was difficult to plan for.
I worked for management companies in Niseko, being a **Operations Manager**. My main responsibilities were:
* Overview of the guest-related operations and processes
* Hiring and Management of seasonal staff
* Problem-solving for guest-related issues
* Managing Owner relations
* Project Management on the hospitality side to open new buildings

I was then hired by **Club Med** to be the **Product Manager for Japan Resorts**, which in practice meant being responsible for problem-solving and product management for three Japanese resorts. (Note that "product management" has a different meaning than the one in tech). I was basically the connection between the company higher managers and the staff in resorts.
For a few reasons, this experience made me realize that I didn't want to become a hotel manager or collect big responsibilities in a huge hospitality company.
So when COVID hit, new opportunities for remote work appeared and I decided to follow a software engineering bootcamp in Tokyo to polish my dev skills and re-start my career as a software engineer.

## Software Engineering
I was always a nerd, first playing videogames on a Thomson T05, then coding in assembly language on my HP48SX in high school.
Working in software engineering was always natural for me:
* As a trader I made scripts in VB and in Python to visualize risks, aggregate data and generate reports
* When I was in hospitality I worked on systems to make processes efficient, for example dealing with the transportation orders in Club Med in an efficient way.
* I learned **Swift** and **Drupal** on the side while I was working in Niseko, but none of those technologies enabled me to earn enough money to support my family.

After the coding bootcamp in Tokyo, I worked in:
* **MIL**, a Japanese start-up providing B2B marketing solutions centered around interactive videos and data collection. The team was amazing but working 100% in Japanese proved difficult and the tech stack was a bit antiquated (the product had to work on Internet Explorer because one of our big clients had a IT policy forbidding staff to install other browsers on their work machines...).
* **Roomboss**, a SaaS specialized in tourism solutions that I used while I work in hospitality. We work in English and the stack is quite modern: Typescript (Angular or React), Cypress for automatic testing etc.
