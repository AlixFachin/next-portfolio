# Blog / Portfolio Next.js theme

## Overview
This repo contains the code corresponding to the theme of my portfolio / blog website.
It has the following features:
* Home page with animations from `particlejs`
* Markdown content management
* Page displaying all the blog entries and blog tags
* `WIP` Multilingual content

I could have a used a CMS - but there is no better way to understand how something works than doing it by yourself!

## Modifying the theme

This repo is based on a `Next.js` repo (version 12).
To edit it, clone the repo and run `npm install` then `npm run dev` to see the site on your local machine

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
